       <h4> My Story </h4> 

<!-- added color and underline to this paragraph -->

       &nbsp; I was born in <b> <span style="color:orange">sunny</span> </b> southern on <u>California</u> December 12th, just three <br> 
       &nbsp; days after my parents <u>first</u> anniversary. I consider myself their first  <br>
       &nbsp; gift.
   </p>
   <p> 
       &nbsp; I have one sibling. My brother is roughly 2 and a half years younger <br>
       &nbsp; than me. He and I are extremely close. We love to watch movies together <br> 
       &nbsp; and play video games. He always beats me in <b> <span style="color:red">Mario</span> <span style="color:green">Kart</span> </b>. 
   </p> 
   
       <h4> Fun Facts! </h4> 
   <p>

<!-- added color, underline, and italics to this paragraph --> 

       &nbsp; When I was four I moved to <u>Idaho</u>. Because I was so young I don't <br> 
       &nbsp; remember what California was like before I left. <br> 
       &nbsp; But a brief 12 years later I moved right back to the same town I was <br>
       &nbsp; born in.  
   </p> 
   <p>
       &nbsp; My name is a <i>palindrome</i>. H A N N A H. It can be spelled forward <br> 
       &nbsp; and backward. In kindergarten I was probably the only kid who knew <br> 
       &nbsp; the word "palindrome" because my dad taught it to me and was <b>adamant</b> <br>
       &nbsp; I knew what it meant. 
   </p>
   <p> 
       &nbsp; I absolutely love peppermint tea! <br>
       &nbsp; Over winter break I found a huge stash in my house and started having a cup <br> 
       &nbsp; at least twice a day. Now at school, my roommate and I have a full-blown <br> 
       &nbsp; tea collection. I thrifted this cute green mug over break. I have at least one <br> 
       &nbsp; cup of peppermint tea a day in it!
